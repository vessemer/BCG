Controls: ENCSR730QNM

ENCSR957FIZ - ChIP-seq (TF ChIP-seq) experiment, with UBTF target.
Contains 2 isogenic replicants,  

Biosample summary: Homo sapiens HepG2 genetically modified (insertion) using CRISPR targeting H. sapiens UBTF. Sonication fragmentation methods was used.  

Both enrichment and control experiments were performed on Illumina NovaSeq 6000 platform with 100bp read length each, further data processing performed via ENCODE4 v1.4.0 GRCh38 pipeline.

Mild to moderate bottlenecking of ChIP-seq assays is mentioned by Library Complexity Audits, measured using PCR Bottlenecking Coefficients 1 and 2 (PBC1 and PBC2)

No information related to UBTF is presented on JASPAR

This gene encodes a member of the HMG-box DNA-binding protein family. The encoded protein plays a critical role in ribosomal RNA transcription as a key component of the pre-initiation complex, mediating the recruitment of RNA polymerase I to rDNA promoter regions. The encoded protein may also play important roles in chromatin remodeling and pre-rRNA processing, and its activity is regulated by both phosphorylation and acetylation. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding multiple isoforms have been observed for this gene. Pseudogenes of this gene are located on the short arm of chromosomes 3, 11 and X and the long arm of chromosome 11.

UBF belongs to the sequence nonspecific class of HMG (high mobility group) proteins. It has six HMG-box homology domains and has been proposed to interact with rDNA as a dimer and to induce six in-phase bends to generate a single 360-loop structure that resembles the nucleosome.
