ENCSR957FIZ - ChIP-seq (TF ChIP-seq) experiment, with UBTF target.
Contains 2 isogenic replicants,  

Biosample summary: Homo sapiens HepG2 genetically modified (insertion) using CRISPR targeting H. sapiens UBTF. Sonication fragmentation methods was used.  

Both enrichment and control experiments were performed on Illumina NovaSeq 6000 platform with 100bp read length each, further data processing performed via ENCODE4 v1.4.0 GRCh38 pipeline.

Mild to moderate bottlenecking of ChIP-seq assays is mentioned by Library Complexity Audits, measured using PCR Bottlenecking Coefficients 1 and 2 (PBC1 and PBC2)

No information related to UBTF is presented on JASPAR
